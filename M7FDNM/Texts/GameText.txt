ðŸŒ‘ BITBLADE - THE BEGINNING ðŸŒ‘

In a land swallowed by darkness, hope is but a whisper.

Monsters roam freely, feeding on fear and chaos.  
The great cities have fallen, and only ruins remain.  
But legends speak of a warrior... forged in silence,  
armed with nothing but a blade â€” and the will to fight back.

That warrior... is you.

The time has come to rise, to take up your sword,  
and carve a path through shadow and fang.

No allies. No mercy.  
Only monsters... and the blade in your hand.

Press any key to begin your journey.
